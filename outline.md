# DIY websites for creatives: Workshop outline

1. Get inspired looking at cool websites like those of [Elliot Cost](https://elliott.computer/) [10 minutes]
1. The what, why, how and why of The DIY Web [15 minutes]
    - why #1 -- personal advantages -- creative freedom, lower cost, owning your creations, websites that download faster...
    - why #2 -- societal advantages -- more interesting, unique, unfiltered websites; potential for mutual aid, community organizing and distribution of information outside of corporate or government controlled channels; more money stays within community rather than going to tech giants; steal fire from and weaken the technocracy (See Last Week Tonight episode on tech monopolies.) There's a lack of technical information online that includes any of the human/ethical considerations, and I hope this can fill that void.
    - why #3 -- my motivation -- Not just early 2000s nostalgia for MySpace. Teaching is fun. I believe in this. I want to help make the Web a better place. I also think there might be (a)vocational opportunities down this path; skill/labor exchange...
    - finding a firm place to stand despite the only constant being change: standards, recommendations, etc
    - the computer is a meta-tool: let the machine do machine stuff good at so you can focus on being creative
    - the Web is for everyone, everywhere, on every device!
    - There's an exception to every rule, including this one.
    - KISS: Keep it simple, Sisyphus (related catchphrase with same basic principle: YAGNI)
1. Our workbench: intro to VSCode and Chrome devtools [15 minutes]
1. Intro to HTML: Tags, elements and the DOM, Oh my! [15 minutes]
    - HTML boilerplate
    - general purpose document manipulation tool (can download current DOM tree as HTML, duplicate active element, delete active element, live-edit text fields with content-editable API, format text inside content-editable elements)
    - How to have multiple pages on your website?
    - An open question: How could the DIY Web, as an alternative to Twitter and other social media, better handle hate speech and disinformation?
      - Lack of notifications that steal your attention is perhaps a feature.
      - It takes more effort to put stuff out there this way. Many trolls probably won't bother.
      - could old school Web rings and cooperative bookmarking subvert big tech's monopoly on how we find and organize information on the Web?
    - tool: automatic menus
    - tool: automatic image gallery/carousel.
    - tool: automatically add alt text and titles to images.
1. The style of elements: intro to CSS [15 minutes]
    - normalize/reset
    - fluid layout
    - scales
    - tool: visually rearrange, resize, rotate and reorder elements
    - tool: visually choose color of elements
    - tool: visually create animations
1. Intro to `git`, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Desktop [25 minutes]
    - The tough love of the command line
    - Thankfully GUIs exist
    - The power of small, focused steps
      - It's hard to think about multiple things at once
    - Time to publish!
1. Celebrate that we have a live website [5-10 minutes]
1. Look polished and professional [15 minutes]
    - Get a custom domain (it costs $$ unless you have one already)
    - Look legit with `https` (free in itself, but requires a custom domain)
1. Search engine (de)optimization: To be, or not to be (on Google)?
1. Whatever else YOU wanna learn about [whatever time remains]
    - integrate store/donation stuff
    - Embedding video/audio
    - Playing Dr Frankenstein with JavaScript
      - Know what you actually need it for
      - JavaScript is a plurality
      - Remember KISS/YAGNI!
    - Optimize large images
    - Ways to avoid copying and pasting the same code over and over again
    - Using more than your OS's built-in fonts
    - Custom 404 page
    - Linkback tracking (probably requires switching to Netlify)
